My Politcial stance : Pakistani youth are pushing for systemic change, demanding transparency, accountability, and an end to dynastic politics. They prioritize economic stability, job creation, and social justice, including gender equality and minority rights. Using social media as a tool for activism, they blend patriotism with a critical approach to governance, striving for a more inclusive and progressive Pakistan.I ant Pakistani poltics to be stable.
